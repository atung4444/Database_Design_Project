# Database_Design_Project
My first project in database design
This project involved the use case with Tucker Electronics, LLC.
Tucker Electronics needs to keep track of their office, electronic, and computer inventory to manage reorder points, better track item locations and reduce overall cost. 
There are two major buildings where items are stored and I was tasked to design, build and query a relational database to answer manager questions.

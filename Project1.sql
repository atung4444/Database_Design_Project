/*
ALTER TABLE vendor ADD PRIMARY KEY(Vendor_ID); 

If a PK contains text data, you must define the length of the primary key, as shown below in the text data of the building code (e.g., NTC) for the building table. 
ALTER TABLE building ADD PRIMARY KEY(Building_Code(3)); 

If the PK is composite, refer to the example below for the room table. Notice the ADD CONSTRAINT statement, where we give the constraint a name (pkc_room) along with identifying the two fields that comprise the primary key.
ALTER TABLE building_room ADD CONSTRAINT pkc_room PRIMARY KEY (BuildingCode(3), Room_Number); 

If you have a table with a PK that has a data type of TEXT, you must modify (alter) the table again to change the data type from TEXT to VARCHAR and identify the appropriate length for that field. Below is an example. The VARCHAR (variable data type with a fixed length of three (instead of the variable length TEXT data type)) will assist as you build the FK in the next steps.
ALTER TABLE building MODIFY Building_Code VARCHAR(3); 

Create the foreign keys to establish the one-to-many (1:M) relationships between the tables in your ERD. See the examples below. Notice the use of a constraint to make the FK. 
ALTER TABLE item ADD CONSTRAINT FK_Vendor_code FOREIGN KEY (Vendor_Code) REFERENCES vendor(Vendor_Code); 

If you need to build a foreign keys to connect to a table with a composite PK,  see the example below. 
ALTER TABLE inventory 
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_Inventory_RoomNumber FOREIGN KEY (BuildingCode, RoomNumber) REFERENCES building_room(BuildingCode, RoomNumber);
